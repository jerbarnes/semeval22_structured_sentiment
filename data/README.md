## Requirements

1. lxml==4.3.2
2. tqdm=4.56.0
3. stanza==1.1.1

## Step 1:

Go to the [MPQA 2.0](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/corpora/mpqa_corpus/mpqa_corpus_2_0/) website, agree to the license and download the corpus. Put the zipped archive in /mpqa. Finally, run the extraction script.

```
bash process_mpqa.sh
```


Go to the [Darmstadt Service Review Corpus](https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/2448) website, agree to the license and download the corpus. Put the zipped archive in /darmstadt_unis and finally, run the extraction script.

```
bash process_darmstadt.sh
```



## Subtask 1: Monolingual structured sentiment
This track assumes that we train and test on the same languages. For this we will use the following datasets:

1. norec (Norwegian professional reviews in multiple domains)
2. multibooked_ca (Catalan hotel reviews)
3. multibooked_eu (Basque hotel reviews)
4. opener_en (English hotel reviews)
5. opener_es (Spanish hotel reviews)
6. darmstadt_unis (English online university reviews)

## Subtask 2: Cross-lingual structured sentiment
This track will instead train only on a high-resource language (English) and test on several languages.

Train:
1. opener_en

Test:
1. opener_es
2. multibooked_ca
3. multibooked_eu
4. Several surprise languages that will not be available until the evaluation phase.

That means that the cross-lingual models should be able to adapt quickly to new languages.


## Data and formatting
We provide the data in json lines format.

Each line is an annotated sentence, represented as a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* 'sent_id': unique sentence identifiers

* 'text': raw text

* 'opinions': list of all opinions (dictionaries) in the sentence

Additionally, each opinion in a sentence is a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* 'Source': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion holder

* 'Target': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion target

* 'Polar_expression': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion expression

* 'Polarity': sentiment label ('negative', 'positive', 'neutral')

* 'Intensity': sentiment intensity ('average', 'strong', 'weak')

    "text": "Even though the price is decent for Paris , I would not recommend this hotel .",

                    "Polar_expression": [["would not recommend"], ["46:65"]],
                    "Polarity": "negative",
                    "Intensity": "average"
                  },
                 {
                    "Source": [[], []],
                    "Target": [["the price"], ["12:21"]],
                    "Polar_expression": [["decent"], ["25:31"]],
                    "Polarity": "positive",
                    "Intensity": "average"}
                ]
}
```

You can import the data by using the json library in python:

```
>>> import json
>>> with open("data/norec/train.json") as infile:
            norec_train = json.load(infile)
```
