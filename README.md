## SemEval-2022 Shared Task 10: Structured Sentiment Analysis

This Github repository hosts the data and baseline models for the [SemEval-2022 shared task 10](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/33556) on structured sentiment. In this repository you will find the datasets, baselines, and other useful information on the shared task.


## LATEST NEWS

**4.02.22**: Evaluation period has finished. We encourage all participants to submit a system description paper (more info to come), deadline is February 23rd. [Guidelines from SemEval](https://semeval.github.io/paper-requirements.html). If you do submit, please cite the [Shared Task Description](#citation).

**11.01.2022**: Added test data for the evaluation phase. Additionally, we corrected the problems associated with issue #9 in train, dev, and test splits. We've also updated the example_submission.zip in the evaluation subrepo for the evaluation phase. Therefore, we recommend you pull the changes.

**09.12.2021**: Updated the evaluation script on codalab, as previous versions gave incorrectly low results when run on codalab due to floor division in python 2.7 (codalab still runs on python 2, see issue #16).

**29.11.2021**: Updated MPQA processing script to remove annotations with no polarity (see issue #20). If you have the data from before this date, you will need to rerun the preprocessing scripts.

**15.11.2021**: Updated Darmstadt and MPQA processing script to remove annotations which contain polar expessions with incorrect offsets, giving errors during evaluation (see issue #17). If you have the data from before this date, you will need to rerun the preprocessing scripts.

**15.10.2021**: Updated Darmstadt processing script to remove annotations which contain polar expessions with no offset (see issue #9).

**6.10.2021**: Updated MPQA and Darmstadt dev data on the codalab. You may need to check your data to make sure that you're working with the newest version in order to submit.

## Problem description

The task is to predict all structured sentiment graphs in a text (see the examples below). We can formalize this as finding all the opinion tuples *O* = *O*<sub>i</sub>,...,*O*<sub>n</sub> in a text. Each opinion *O*<sub>i</sub> is a tuple *(h, t, e, p)*

where *h* is a **holder** who expresses a **polarity** *p* towards a **target** *t* through a **sentiment expression** *e*, implicitly defining the relationships between the elements of a sentiment graph.

The two examples below (first in English, then in Basque) give a visual representation of these *sentiment graphs*.

Participants can then either approach this as a sequence-labelling task, or as a graph prediction task.

## Subtasks
### Monolingual
This track assumes that you train and test on the same language. Participants will need to submit results for seven datasets in five languages.

 The datasets can be found in the [data](./data) directory.

#### Data

| Dataset | Language | # sents | # holders | # targets | # expr. |
| --------| -------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| [NoReC_fine](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.618/) | Norwegian | 11437 | 1128|8923 |11115 |
| [MultiBooked_eu](https://aclanthology.org/L18-1104/) | Basque |1521 |296 |1775 |2328 |
| [MultiBooked_ca](https://aclanthology.org/L18-1104/) | Catalan |1678 |235 |2336 |2756 |
| [OpeNER_es](http://journal.sepln.org/sepln/ojs/ojs/index.php/pln/article/view/4891) | Spanish |2057 |255 |3980 |4388 |
| [OpeNER_en](http://journal.sepln.org/sepln/ojs/ojs/index.php/pln/article/view/4891) | English |2494 |413 |3850 |4150 |
| [MPQA](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/) | English | 10048 | 2279| 2452 | 2814 |
| [Darmstadt_unis](https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/2448) | English | 2803 | 86 | 1119 | 1119 |

### Cross-lingual
This track will explore how well models can generalize across languages. The test data will be the `MultiBooked Datasets (Catalan and Basque)` and the `OpeNER Spanish` dataset. For training, you can use any of the other datasets, as well as any other resource that does not contain sentiment annotations in the target language.

This setup is often known as zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and we will assume that all submissions follow this format.


## Evaluation

The two subtasks will be evaluated separately. In both tasks, the evaluation will be based on [Sentiment Graph F<sub>1</sub>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14504).


This metric defines true positive as an *exact match* at
graph-level, *weighting the overlap* in predicted and
gold spans for each element, averaged across all
three spans.

For *precision* we weight the number
of correctly predicted tokens divided by the total
number of predicted tokens (for *recall*, we divide
instead by the number of gold tokens), allowing
for empty holders and targets which exist in the gold standard.


 The leaderboard for each dataset, as well as the average of all 7. The winning submission will be the one that has the highest average Sentiment Graph F<sub>1</sub>.


## Data format

We provide the data in json lines format.

Each line is an annotated sentence, represented as a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* `'sent_id'`: unique sentence identifiers

* `'text'`: raw text version of the previously tokenized sentence

* `opinions'`: list of all opinions (dictionaries) in the sentence

Additionally, each opinion in a sentence is a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* `'Source'`: a list of text and character offsets for the opinion holder

* `'Target'`: a list of text and character offsets for the opinion target

* `'Polar_expression'`: a list of text and character offsets for the opinion expression

* `'Polarity'`: sentiment label ('Negative', 'Positive', 'Neutral')

* `'Intensity'`: sentiment intensity ('Average', 'Strong', 'Weak')

                    "Polar_expression": [["would not recommend"], ["46:65"]],
                    "Polarity": "Negative",
                    "Intensity": "Average"
                  },
                 {
                    "Source": [[], []],
                    "Target": [["the price"], ["12:21"]],
                    "Polar_expression": [["decent"], ["25:31"]],

                    "Intensity": "Average"}
                ]
}
```

You can import the data by using the json library in python:

```
>>> import json
>>> with open("data/norec/train.json") as infile:
            norec_train = json.load(infile)
```

## Resources:
The task organizers provide training data, but participants are free to use other resources (word embeddings, pretrained models, sentiment lexicons, translation lexicons, translation datasets, etc). We do ask that participants document and cite their resources well.

We also provide some links to what we believe could be helpful resources:

1. [pretrained word embeddings](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/)
2. [pretrained language models](https://huggingface.co/models)
3. [translation data](https://opus.nlpl.eu/)
4. [sentiment resources](https://github.com/jerbarnes/sentiment_resources)
5. [syntactic parsers](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)


## Submission via Codalab
Submissions will be handled through our [codalab competition website](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/33556).

## Baselines

The task organizers provide two baselines: one that takes a sequence-labelling approach and a second that converts the problem to a dependency graph parsing task. You can find both of them in [baselines](./baselines).
